# My Crypto Alexa Skill

## Description:
This is an Alexa Skills App I built using both Coinbase and NiceHash APIs to get my total balances, as well as toggle my mining rig on and off. Some of the future goals are to move from using API keys/secrets to OAuth authentication, as well as adding notifications for mining rig status.
